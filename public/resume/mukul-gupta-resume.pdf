(This response is a placeholder. Since I cannot create or access real PDF files, the actual "code" for `public/resume/mukul-gupta-resume.pdf` is the PDF file itself. The instructions indicate that the download buttons are already configured to link to this file. Therefore, no code needs to be generated or modified. The user needs to manually create or obtain the PDF file and place it in the specified directory.)
